Discrete-Valued Neural Networks Using Variational Inference
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1h2DllAW
    -Rejected from ICLR btw, so quality may be questionable

THE CONCRETE DISTRIBUTION: A CONTINUOUS RELAXATION OF DISCRETE RANDOM VARIABLES
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.00712.pdf
    -Discrete distribution defined as Discrete(alpha1, alpha2, ... alphan) aka unnormalized probabilities
    over n discrete values
    	-Probabilites of selection for each of the n discrete values would be alpha_i/(sum of all alpha)
	-Another way to look at this is to calculate
		alpha_i + G_i, where G_i is sampled from a simple Gumbel distribution, and choose the maximum value, 
		which will be your sampled value
     -Concrete Random Variables extend this alternative view by generalizing taking the max(alpha_i + G_i) by adding
     a LAMBDA, or the temperature variable, and performing a softmax over alpha_i + G_i. When lambda =0, you will get the discrete distribution
     -Concrete Distribution has a distirubtion parameterized on alpha and lambda
     -Properties of Concrete Distribution
     	-You can reparemterize distirubtion (in stochastic nodes for back prop for example) with Gumbel
	-You can round a concrete distribution to a discrete distirubtion by doing integration
	-As lmabda ->0, the pdf is discrete
	-Somwhat convex
     -Any loss function that has E_some discrete distribution(something) can be relaxed into the continuous concrete distribution

Gaussian Process Neurons
https://openreview.net/pdf?id=By-IifZRW
    -Rejected from ICLR, but they say its a very cool idea with no experiments hence rejection

Differentiable Neural Network Architecture Search
https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJ-MRKkwG
	-Convert neural network architecture discrete hyperparameters into continuous ones
	-Should focus on this paper albeit short, since workshop talk
	-What is the method???

Variational Dropout Sparsifies Deep Neural Networks
https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05369
	-Dropout is typically a bernoulli variable * weights, but dropout can also be weights*normal(1, alpha)
		-alpha = p/(1-p) for bernoulli(p), where p is dropout rate; p->1, alpha -> infinite = DROP that beat
	-Variational infernence is used on the weights parameterized by N(theta_ij, alpha_ij) for each weight w_ij
	-Prior for P(w) is improper log scale uniform
	-Now you can train individual dropouts for each weight/node!
