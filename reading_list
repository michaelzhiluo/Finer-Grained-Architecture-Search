    -Rejected from ICLR, but they say its a very cool idea with no experiments hence rejection

Structured Exploration via Hierarchical Variational Policy Networks

Differentiable Neural Network Architecture Search
https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJ-MRKkwG
	-Convert neural network architecture discrete hyperparameters into continuous ones
	-Should focus on this paper albeit short, since workshop talk
	-What is the method???
