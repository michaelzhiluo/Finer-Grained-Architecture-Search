Discrete-Valued Neural Networks Using Variational Inference
https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1h2DllAW
    -Rejected from ICLR btw, so quality may be questionable

THE CONCRETE DISTRIBUTION: A CONTINUOUS RELAXATION OF DISCRETE RANDOM VARIABLES
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.00712.pdf
    -Potential use for hyperparameter optimization

XNOR-Net: ImageNet Classification Using Binary Convolutional Neural Networks
