Winning Ticket Hypothesis
https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635
    - Algorithm:
        -Initialize Network with weights, w0
        -Loop:
            -Train till convergence
            -Prune smallest weights
            -Take the pruned network and reinitialize the remaining weights to w0
    - Larger networks have a larger combination of "winning tickets" (subnetworks that have a good combination during 
    initialization w0 that result in high accuracy), hence the idea of pruning
    - how do they parameterize the pruned network? do they zero out the weights?
