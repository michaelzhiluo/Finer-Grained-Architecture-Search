-think about weight sharing: 
  -how can we setup the meta-learning problem so that we can learn an interesting weight-sharing structure?
  -how can we adapt "soft weight-sharing" so that online pruning / collapsing is possible?
  -how can we take insight from the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, which accomplishes drastic pruning with little loss in accuracy?
  -how can we take insight from L0 regularization for online pruning?
-more papers!
